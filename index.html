		<p class="about"> The Zika virus is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. People usually don't get sick enough to go to the hospital, and they rarely die of Zika. For this reason, many people might not realize they have been infected. Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections. Zika virus was first discovered in 1947 and is named after the Zika forest in Uganda. In 1952, the first human cases of Zika were detected and since then, outbreaks of Zika have been reported in tropical Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. </p>
