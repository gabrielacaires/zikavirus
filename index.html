		<p class="about"> <span style="font-size: 40px; font-family: cursive;">"</span> The Zika virus is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. Typically in most cases people usually don't get sick enough to go to the hospital, and they rarely die of Zika. For this reason, many people might not realize they have been infected. Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections. The Zika virus was first discovered in 1947, it is named after the Zika forest in Uganda. In 1952, the first human cases of Zika were detected and since then, outbreaks of Zika have been reported in tropical Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands <span style="font-size: 40px; font-family: cursive;">"</span>.</p> 

		<p class="second"> <span style="font-size: 40px; font-family: cursive;">"</span> Since it was first discovered in Uganda in 1947, Zika virus was known mostly as a short-lived and mild illness. In 2015, that all changed the Pan American Health Organization issued an alert regarding the first confirmed Zika virus infection in Brazil.. An outbreak in Brazil is suspected of causing cases of a serious birth defect, microcephaly, and a potentially crippling disease,<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/guillainbarre.htm" target="_blank" class="disease">Guillain-Barre Syndrome</a>.On Feb 1, 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Zika virus a public health emergency of international concern<span style="font-size: 40px; font-family: cursive;">"</span>.</p>

		<p class="third"> <span style="font-size: 40px; font-family: cursive;">"</span> Scientists have yet to prove without a doubt that the mosquito-borne Zika virus causes <a href = "http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/microcephaly.html" target="_blank" class="change"> microcephaly</a>. A big study involving 5,000 women being conducted right now will help determine that, but the results won't be out until mid-year. This much smaller study by UCLA researchers, however, strengthens the link between the virus and various birth defects -- not just microcephaly -- as well as fetal death. In addition, the researchers found that Zika can affect pregnancy at any stage and trimester. The study's senior author, Dr. Karin Nielsen, said they saw problems with pregnant women eight weeks, 22 weeks, 25 weeks and even 35 weeks along. Women that are pregant are urged to not currently travel<span style="font-size: 40px; font-family: cursive;">"</span>.</p>
