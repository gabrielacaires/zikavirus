		<h2> FAQ Page for The Zika Virus: Your Top Questions Answered </h2>

		<p class="first"> Why Should I be concerned about the Zika Virus? </p>
		<p class="firstanswer"> Although Zika infections are usually mild, when they strike pregnant women, it is possible for the infections to lead to a condition called <a href = "http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/microcephaly.html" target="_blank" class="change"> microcephaly</a> in the women's children, which brings severe, lifelong impairments.</p>

		<p class="secondparagraph"> Where Did The Zika Virus Originate? </p>
		<p class="secondparagraphanswer"> Researchers first identified the Zika virus in rhesus monkeys in Uganda in 1947, during a project dedicated to finding yellow fever. A few years later, in 1952, they found the first human cases in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania, according to the WHO. Since then, Zika outbreaks have occurred in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific region, the WHO has stated. Brazil experienced its first outbreak in <span style="font-weight: bold;">May 2015</span>.</p>

		<p class="thirdparagraph"> How Do People Contract The Zika Virus? </p>
		<p class="thirdparagraphanswer">The primary way that people contract Zika is from the bites of infected mosquitoes. Zika can also spread during sexual intercourse, although there are few confirmed cases of this occurring. In one case report, doctors described finding the virus in the sperm of a man in Tahiti in December 2013. It's also possible that Zika could spread through blood transfusions. There are no instances, to date, of breast milk transmission, and women in Zika areas should continue breastfeeding. </p>

		<p class="fourthparagraph"> What Symptoms Do Infected Individuals Typically Display?</p>
		<p class="fourthparagraphanswer"> Most people infected with Zika virus won't know they have the disease because they do not display the common symptoms. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, or <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/" class="conjunctivitis"> conjunctivitis</a> . Other common symptoms include muscle pain and headache. The incubation period, the time from exposure to symptoms for Zika virus disease is not offically known, but is likely to be a few days to a week. See your healthcare provider if you are pregnant and develop a fever, rash, joint pain, or red eyes within 2 weeks after traveling to a place where Zika has been reported. Be sure to tell your health care provider where you traveled. The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting for several days to a week after being bitten by an infected mosquito. People usually don't get sick enough to go to the hospital, and they very rarely die of Zika. For this reason, many people might not realize they have been infected. The Zika virus usually remains in the blood of an infected person for about a week but it can be found longer in some people. Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections.</p>

		<p class="fifthparagraph"> How is The Zika Virus Diagnosised? </p>
		<p class="fifthparagraphanswer"> The symptoms of Zika are similar to those of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/dengue/" class="dengue">dengue</a> and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/index.html" class="chikungunya"> chikungunya</a>, diseases spread through the same mosquitoes that transmit Zika. See your healthcare provider if you develop the symptoms described above and have visited an area where Zika is found. If you have recently traveled, tell your healthcare provider when and where you traveled. Your healthcare provider may order blood tests to look for Zika or other similar viruses like dengue or chikungunya. </p>
